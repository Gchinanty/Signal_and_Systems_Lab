# Signals and Systems Lab
Several experiments about signal and systems I did in WHU.

## dsp Audio signal spectrum analysis & dsp Face detection
These are two verification demos when I learn to develop DSP chip which named TMS32C6748.

## Function Plotting and Analysis
This is an MATLAB GUI which can draw an image of a multidimensional function and differentiate the function.

## Other Labs
These are several small code snippets when I conduct my *Signals and Systems Lab*ã€‚
